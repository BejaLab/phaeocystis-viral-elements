Phaeocystis viral elements
==========================

The repository contains the bioinformatic workflow used for extraction of viral elements from *Phaeocystis* genomes for the paper Roitman et al (2023) "Infection cycle and phylogeny of a Polinton-like virus with a virophage lifestyle infecting *Phaeocystis globosa*".

The workflow is built using [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/). Dependencies are under the control of conda (see `--use-conda`). Run as `snakemake --cores 10 --use-conda`.
